# Calculator
This project is a simple calculator app using Python and Tkinter in order to create a GUI for the calculator. It has a add, subtract, multiply, and divide
On top of this there is also the exponent function and a pi button to express values with pi
Lastly there is a DEL and C button to either clear the entire line or just remove one number at a time
As of now it is fully functional and I plan on later adding a multiple line entry bar to see previous calculations as well as other buttons such as trig and ln and log
